parameters
ml(means-like): require that the results have a meaning related to this string value, which can be any word or sequence of words.

sl(sounds-like):require that the results are pronounced similarly to this string of characters. 
(If the string of characters doesn't have a known pronunciation, the system will make its best 
guess using a text-to-phonemes algorithm.) 

sp(spelled-like):  A pattern can include any combination of alphanumeric characters, spaces, 
and two reserved characters that represent placeholders — * (which matches any number of characters) 
and ? (which matches exactly one character). 
    
code: dictionary({jja : word ...}), require that the results, when paired with the word in this parameter, are in a predefined lexical relation indicated by [code].
Any number of these parameters may be specified any number of times.(theese code are explained above)

v(vocabulary): Identifier for the vocabulary to use

topics (Topic words): An optional hint to the system about the theme of the document being written

max: Maximum number of results to return
md 	Metadata flags: A list of single-letter codes (no delimiter) requesting
that extra lexical knowledge be included with the results.
